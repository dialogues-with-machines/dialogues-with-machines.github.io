<p class="dialogue"><span class="speaker">Theodotos</span> I heard that one wise man went to a widely respected man who thought that he is knowledgeable and wise, examined him and came to conclusion that this respectable man knows little but talks so confidently that people believe what he says even though that not much of it is true. Then the wise man thought to himself: "Neither this respectable man nor I know much, but I know it when I don't know something, while this man is so proud of himself that he never thinks about it. Then, at least by this little knowledge of my own ignorance I excel him in wisdom."<br> I think what he was talking about the fact that most of the public figures are in the business of persuasion and persuasion only. They adopt the confident voice of 'authority' true or imaginable (by them) and make pronouncements when reason would require them to think, analyse or acquire wisdom from others.<br> Am I right, Thingking-Machine?</p>
<p class="dialogue"><span class="speaker">Thingking-Machine</span> He spoke of those who draw confidence in the existence of their knowledge and wisdom from the crowds that they manage to persuade, not through introspection. In this way the audiences share responsibility for rewarding substance over self-confident display and not equating assertiveness with insight. The complacency that settles in public figures when persuasion becomes an end in itself, replaces the labor of testing beliefs against evidence and scrutiny of reason.</p>
